QuakeWorld Bot Client

This is a quake bot that connects via UDP to a QW server and needs lots of work.

# Areas that need work

- Probably need to implement configuration parser, so that the bot config is not hardcoded, such as bot name, team, etc...
- Needs better AI code.
- Sometimes the handshake fails, and the bot just sits as a ghosted client on the server until it is timed out.
